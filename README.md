# OpenAI Chat Magic

This is the results of a test of the OpenAI Chat application. It is magical. I asked the application to build me a simple Pokédex using the Lit web-component framework and the PokéAPI, and it did. I asked it to provide some simple styles, and it mostly did.

I've deviated from its instructions a bit, but the code is entirely generated by OpenAI's application (unless there's a console.log() in there - I was trying to suss out issues so I could explain it and have them corrected).

I also ended up using the by Lit recommended [rollup-starter-app template from here](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-app) instead of faffing about with Babel.

You can use the same instructions there to run the application.

In the latest iteration the moves table is broken, unfortunately. I did not think to make a git repo early on, but the earliest code should still function.

I'd wager one could get the AI to iron out the issue by providing it the code and explaining what the issue is, but it's much too late right now and I'd like to sleep.
